+
  +DSFS is IBM's Data Set File System released with z/OS 2.5 and available
  +with all releases of z/OS since. It provides 'easy' Unix-like access to
  +z/OS datasets from the OMVS environment.
  +
  +This dialog provides a simple way to access the DSFS commands for those
  +who don't remember what commands are available, or their syntax, because
  +the commands are used infrequently.
  +
  +For information on the Data Set File System find the IBM publications for
  +this feature.
